# IDKDO (id√©es cadeau)

This is a small training project to learn **Angular** and API requests. It was done in pairs, during courses with the training organisation *Simplon*.

This app uses the ChatGPT API to generate a list of gift ideas depending on criteras such as age, gender and interests of the person.

**Using the app requires a valid OpenAI API key and credits.**

## Features

- Enter (or not) criteras such as gender, name, age and/or up to 3 interests to make a search
- Browse gift ideas with descriptions, price and auto-generated example pictures
- Save gift ideas for later - they appear at the bottom of the page, where they can also be deleted

## Technologies

- Angular 15
- JSON server
